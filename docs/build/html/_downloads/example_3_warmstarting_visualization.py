Example 3 - Warmstarting
========================

This examples covers the warmstart functionality
We will start an optimizer run with a small budget
Then we'll shutdown the master, but keep the nameserver alive.
And finally, restarting the optimization run with a new master and a larger budget

In the end, we'll introduce an interactive visualization tool.
With this tool, we can illustrate the progress of the optimizer.
